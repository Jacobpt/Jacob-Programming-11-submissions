Brief guide:
      To create an array, first type a number into the 'size of your array' text box, then select one of the four
      available types. Once you click the 'Create' button, an array of the specified size and type will be created
      and assigned to MainArray.

      Then, go to the 'Test' section. clicking the 'Run Tests' button will run MainArray through all 4 sorting
      algorithms, recording the amount of changes (ie any use of '=') and comparisons (any use of a comparison operator).
      A swap will be recorded as three changes, since you need to change 3 variables to swap 2 numbers.

      Once the labels are filled with values, you can press the 'Record Results' button to save your results to a
      ListView in the 'Recent Results' tab.

      From there you can preview your results by clicking on any element of the list, and the appropriate labels
      will fill up to show the full results of your test.

      If you wish to save those results, type a file name in the text box below the 'Save to file' button, which will
      print your results into that file. There is no need to add ".txt" to the end. It will not empty your ListView.
      Load From File works intuitively, and does not clear the file.

      Neither Save nor load will append to the file/list
